## Projects Pages
These pages contain projects realised in the physical world. They generally centre around electronics and music, although wood working and pathetic attempts at metal working will occasionally make an appearance :)

My core interest here is electronics in audio. I've built quite a few amplifiers for hi-fi stereo systems and musical instruments. I also tinker with distortion effects circuits for guitar/bass.
