I joined the online teaching resource [Team Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com) in 2015 to start my journey in development.
I completed the front-end track, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. More important than language-specifics, I learnt to how to approach web-design: from a dynamic,
mobile-first perspective; and how to make best use of programmatically setting styling and layout rules.
Ever since I first learned C/C++ back in my student days, I've always hated hard-coding variables and I try to avoid it as much as I can. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the modern web is filled with people who think the same thing, and that it wasn't like I remember it in the bad old days of HTML 3.2.
