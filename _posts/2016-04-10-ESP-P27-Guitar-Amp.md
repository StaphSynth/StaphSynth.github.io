I picked up the guitar for the first time in late 2014. After years of on-and-off attempting to play various wind instruments, as well as a good go at piano, I'd finally found the instrument for me. I'm not a virtuoso by any stretch of even the most fevered imagination, but I feel far more comfortable with a guitar in my hands than I ever felt playing anything else.

So after purchasing my first electric guitar to practice on, I needed to contruct an amplifier to plug it in to. I chose the [ESP](http://sound.westhost.com/index2.html) [P27](http://sound.westhost.com/project27.htm) for several reasons.
