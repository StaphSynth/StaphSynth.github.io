I picked up the guitar for the first time in late 2014. After years of on-and-off attempting to play various wind instruments, as well as a good go at piano, I'd finally found the instrument for me. I'm not a virtuoso by any stretch of even the most fevered imagination, but I feel far more comfortable with a guitar in my hands than I ever felt playing anything else.

So after purchasing my first electric guitar to practice on, I needed to construct an amplifier to plug it in to. I chose the [ESP](http://sound.westhost.com/index2.html){: target="\_blank"} [P27](http://sound.westhost.com/project27.htm){: target="\_blank"} for several reasons.

It's designed by Rod Elliott of ESP. I've built quite a few of his designs, and they always give an excellent account of themselves and work exactly as described. Rod's approach is always to make a design as flexible as possible, whilst still providing excellent performance. It's a solid state design, which is fine by me. There's a lot of crap floating around the net about the almost magical properties of [valves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube){: target="\_blank"} (tubes) - especially by people who know nothing about electronics. All sorts of (often contrasting) properties are ascribed to them, with very little in terms of rational thought to be found in the immediate area. For an interesting discussion on the properties of valves that's grounded in reality, please see [these articles](http://sound.westhost.com/valves/index.html){: target="\_blank"} by Rod Elliott.

Most of the things said about valves are a load of horse shit. Occasionally, people will actually get something right about them. I think the most important thing to bear in mind, however, is that a valve is simply an amplifying device. Choosing to use a different amplifying device, doesn't make that choice inferior, it makes it different. This is especially relevant given that this is a guitar amplifier: we aren't interested in fidelity, we're interested in creating a sound that's unique and pleasing.

In this case the different choice was easy to make: a solid state amplifier is far cheaper to build, doesn't require a high voltage power supply, and will be lighter and smaller without the need for a huge output transformer. It also won't cook itself with the heat.

Okay, so I chose the amp to build. What next?

I ordered the boards for the pre-amp and power amp from ESP. I could have made my own, but they were cheap and board sales help keep the ESP audio pages online. Then I got to work making a chassis. I decided to make it out of wood, because my metal-working skills really suck. I also decided that, unlike all my existing hi-fi power amps, having the heatsink just hanging off the back of the chassis was asking for trouble. A stereo amp spends its life sitting idly on a bench. A guitar amp is bound to get moved around, so I wanted the heatsink to be somewhat protected from knocks.

My final design was to sandwich the heatsink between the top and bottom of the case, with a cut-out to allow airflow over the fins. The front panel was also recessed by 15mm to help protect the switches and knobs as well.

The electronics were to be bolted to the bottom of the case, with the top and sides being joined together to form a lid the goes over the whole assembly. The 'lid' bolts on to the bottom via 6m bolts through the sides into 3mm aluminium angle brackets with 6mm thread tapped into them. Here's a test-fit to make sure it's all going to work. The transformer is complete overkill - it was sitting around from a different project I decided to scrap. You could get a way with one almost half the size. The walls seperating the different parts of the amplifier are to provide internal shielding against mutual interference and were eventually covered in copper tape.

Once I'd worked all that out, I covered the insides of the box with aluminium foil to shield the electronics from extraneous interference. Guitar preamps have massive gain, so they can easily amplify even minute unwanted signals into audible irritations. No-one wants to hear the local AM radio station through their speaker cab (or at all, really... ;) My approach is to use a dilute solution (approx 1:10) of ordinary PVA woodworking glue. Spread the glue across the wood with an old paint brush, apply the foil, smooth it down, and then use a sharp hobby knife to trim the foil just inside the edge of the wood panel.

The right-angle aluminium brackets were then attached to the base and bolted to the sides. Once the sides were judged to be sitting perfectly square, holes were drilled in the top of the sides for dowels to connect them to the lid permanently. The dowels glued in, the top put on and the whole thing clamped together overnight to ensure it didn't shift while the glue set.
