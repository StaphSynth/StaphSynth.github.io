Today, I celebrate a minor milestone on the journey to becoming a better developer: my first pull request merged into an open source project!

The project in question is [Samson](https://github.com/zendesk/samson), a deployment platform used at Zendesk and by other companies.

My contribution is not large, but involves cleaning up some of the code on the 'new deploy' page and fixing a bug. This opens the way to adding a feature to the page that lists the Jira issue status of each PR to be pushed out in the new deploy. This, in turn, will make it easier for the person creating the deploy to determine if a given PR is ready to go out or not.

Baby steps. _Code on_ :)
