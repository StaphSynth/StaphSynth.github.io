I did this course in the midddle of 2015, during the university mid-year break while I wasn't teaching. It actually consisted of two modules: an introduction to testing, and professional test practices. It was my first look into what IT is in a professional context. In the past I've knocked-out quite a few of my own programs in C/C++, but I hadn't been exposed to how that is handled in a corporate environment. The material was well thought-out and explained quite well how complex systems are systematically broken down into a series of simple boolean statements - not unlike the way real-word computers solve difficult problems. In fact, the problem-solving methodology was quite similar to that of the scientific method, so I felt quite at ease with the approach.
