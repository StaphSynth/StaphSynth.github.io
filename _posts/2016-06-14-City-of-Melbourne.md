I knocked up this quick demo site to play around with some ideas on mobile-first navigation menu design. This was largely in response to lessons I learned when making [howtoscience.net](http://www.howtoscience.net). Basically, I thought I could do better. I was also interested in playing with using images as backgrounds and other things. Most of the ideas from this mock-up made their way into the site you're looking at now :)
