## About Me
It's true, I'm a nerd. My name is David Allen and I'm a thirty-ish year old boy, still pulling things apart to see how they work. If I learn anything useful, I apply it. My personal philosophy in this respect is two-fold: (1) knowledge is power, and; (2) don't learn what to think, learn _how_ to think.

I studied science for years. I have a degree (with Honours! ;) in science (I studied [microbiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology)). I've worked as a researcher, teacher, lab technician and general dogsbody. I have a few published peer-reviewed papers to my name. I even did most of a PhD. It's funny, in a way, how pulling things apart for science just didn't cut it for me any more. For various reasons, including an attempt to restore something of my sanity, I decided to leave science and shift my career to my other great love: computers.

Now I do front-end development, working on various websites in an attempt to break into the industry. I also solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in my spare time. In some ways, it can be more rewarding, becuase you get to actually _make_ stuff, rather than just figure out how it works and leave all the practical applications to someone else. My first project was an academic resource for science students, called [howtoscience.net](http://www.howtoscience.net) which aims to help science students improve their report-writing skills.

You may notice on these pages that I like to make stuff. This is really what the site is about. It's something of a record for me of what I've done, so I can look it up later when I inevitably forget the details. Hopefully, maybe some other people will learn a few things from my mistakes as well.
