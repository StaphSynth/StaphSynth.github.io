Throw out the bread board version and re-build the circuit on prototyping board and verify that it actually works:</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/va-testing.jpg" alt="It's useful to tape the jacks down so the weight of the cables doesn't drag the board off the bench."/> <figcaption> It's useful to tape the jacks down so the weight of the cables doesn't drag the board off the bench. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Step2. Buy a cheap die-cast aluminium case, drill some holes in it and paint it:</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/va-case.jpg" alt="This was the most expensive part of the whole build at around ten dollars."/> <figcaption> This was the most expensive part of the whole build at around ten dollars. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Step 3. Assemble the components in the box:</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/va-assembly.jpg" alt="Wiring the pots to the board was a bit fiddly. The rear of the board was then insulated from the case by hot-gluing a piece of cardboard to it."/> <figcaption> Wiring the pots to the board was a bit fiddly. The rear of the board was then insulated from the case by hot-gluing a piece of cardboard to it. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Step4: Profit!</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/va-complete.jpg" alt="I won't use stick-on labels for a pedal again as they don't stick down well to the orange-peel texture of several coats of spray paint."/> <figcaption> I won't use stick-on labels for a pedal again as they don't stick down well to the orange-peel texture of several coats of spray paint. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/va-running.jpg" alt="The top needed a bit of jazzing up.

I quite like the lo-fi effect of simply drawing on it with a paint marker. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>And there it is, a proper effects pedal for around $30. The most expensive components were the case and the foot switch, which made up the bulk of the cost. The rest of it was jelly-bean parts I already had lying around. It also uses an NE5532 opamp instead of the noisy 4558.</p> <p>As I said above, it’s basically a knock-off of the Tube Screamer, but with a modified tone circuit and a slightly different feed-back path. I use it to play things like Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and The Offspring. If you turn the distortion right down, you can get a pretty cool ‘dirty blues’ kind of sound out of it as well.
