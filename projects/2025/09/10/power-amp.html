It’s a “moderate power” <a href="https://sound-au.com/project3a.htm">ESP P3A</a> that’s intended to drive a pair of bookshelf speakers.</p> <p>It’s been quite a while since I’ve undertaken a project like this and I found I had to re-learn a bunch of things while doing it. But it’s been a lot of fun and I really enjoyed working on it.</p> <h3 id="the-chassis">The Chassis</h3> <p>The chassis design is very similar to the one from my <a href="/projects/2016/04/10/ESP-P27-Guitar-Amp.html">guitar amplifier</a> but this time I opted to have the heasink hanging off the back rather than more integrated into the box. This made construction a little easier and I don’t mind doing it on hi-fi amps because they generally sit in one place all the time, whereas guitar amplifiers tend to get moved around a lot and might suffer the odd knock.</p> <p>The chassis is made from simple pine from the local hardware shop. I rounded off the front corners and put a bull-nose on the edges with a router to soften its appearance a bit.</p> <p>The insides are lined with aluminium foil to create a Faraday cage around the electronics. To do this, I paint the timber with a very light layer of heavily-watered-down (&gt;10:1) PVA wood glue, apply the foil and smooth it out, before trimming away the excess with a hobby knife.</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/2025-09/MP3A_box_pieces.jpg" alt="The pieces of the box after foil application and ready for assembly."/> <figcaption> The pieces of the box after foil application and ready for assembly. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>As with my guitar amplifier, the bottom of the case holds the electronics and the top and sides are joined permanently to form a kind of “lid” that screws down over the whole assembly.</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/2025-09/MP3A_side_dowel_prep.jpg" alt="Preparing the sides for dowels to join them to the top."/> <figcaption> Preparing the sides for dowels to join them to the top. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/2025-09/MP3A_box_clamp.jpg" alt="Glued and clamped."/> <figcaption> Glued and clamped. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>I finished the outside with a satin-finish “chocolate walnut” all-in-one varnish and stain combination. I found this to be difficult to apply and had to thin it out a bit with turpentine to be able to get an even coat. After several coats, I think it’s come up rather well.</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/2025-09/MP3A_box_varnish_complete.jpg" alt="The pieces during varnishing.

It’s difficult to plan how the components themselves will sit on the board with nothing to use as a reference point.</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/2025-09/MP3A_ps_board_1.jpg" alt="The power supply during early construction"/> <figcaption> The power supply during early construction </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Now I make them by covering a piece of prototyping board with adhesive copper tape and cutting away excess material to create tracks as I go.

I like the clean look and I think it’s all pretty self-explanatory anyway. I did add some labels to the rear as they are important - especially the fuse and voltage rating. The labels were made with a label maker and I discovered that you can get white-on-black tape for them, so that was quite nice.</p> <div class="article-figure-container"> <figure class="article-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/2025-09/MP3A_finished_rear.jpg" alt="The rear of the unit."/> <figcaption> The rear of the unit. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Here it is working and ready for delivery to my friend.
